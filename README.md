## Technologies

Python 3.7 and above and has been constructed in the jupyter lab notebook named ```forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb```
The following libraries are required:

- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - for analyzing data
- [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/) - for an IDE
- [tensor flow](https://pypi.org/project/tensor-flow/) - for creating neural network
- [sci-kit learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) - for ML model built on top of SciPy
- [pathlib](https://pypi.org/project/pathlib2/) - for creating object oriented file modules
